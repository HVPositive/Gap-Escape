# Running The Game

The executables folder contains two versions of the game. NoVR is a build with keyboard/mouse controls. Final Build is the VR version.

It is possible to run the game through the Unity editor but changing scenes will result in incorrect lighting. If the game is run through the Unity Editor, the current version will be loaded with VR controls. Use the prefab "Main Camera" instead of "CameraRig" to make keyboard+mouse controls work.
